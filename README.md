Light Bulb it's a web application developed during the curricular unit "Web Programming I", inserted into the Web Information Systems and Technologies degree of the Polytechnic of Porto, Portugal.

With Light Bulb we intended to create a friendly and challenging platform where the school community could post questions and answers related to their curricular units. Light Bulb turns school queries into a game by introducing some competition between users and creating achievements for the players.
